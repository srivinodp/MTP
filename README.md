## Model1
The model1.py contains the 3D CNN Model, where you can train by experimenting with epochs, optimizers and so on.  
I have taken part of architecture from shwoo93 video decaptioning.  
I trained the model on 5000 videos for two days on GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card.(used data augmentation)
## Model2
The model2.py contains the mask learnable 2D CNN Model.  

# Note:  
For model1 use extract_train.py, for model2 use extract_oneframe.py
