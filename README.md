## Model1
The model1.py contains the 3D cnn Model, where you can train by experimenting with epochs, optimizers and so on.  
We have taken some of the code from shwoo93 video decaptioning.  
We trained the model on 5000 videos for two days on GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card.
## Model2
The model2.py contains the mask learnable 2D cnn Model.  

# Note:  
For model1 use extract_train.py, for model2 use extract_oneframe.py
